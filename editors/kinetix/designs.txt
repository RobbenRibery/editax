1. Identify necessary skills:
   • Motor control: the policy must learn when to manually control motor joints versus relying on automatic settings.
   • Thruster control: the policy must appropriately deploy thrusters to influence the dynamics.
   • Weight and inertia management: the policy needs to account for object densities (mass) that affect collision dynamics.
   • Position and dynamics sensitivity: small shifts in object positions can change collision outcomes and reward signals.
   • Role identification: the policy must interpret shape roles that encode goals/hazards.

2. Minimum necessary set of states:
   • States where the densities of movable shapes are slightly lower (easier to move) versus slightly higher (more inertia).
   • States that differ in the motor_auto flag (all controls automatic vs. all controls manual).
   • States with small random perturbations in the positions of movable elements that can affect collision and navigation.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   • mmp_reduce_density: decreases shape densities (reducing difficulty).
   • mmp_increase_density: increases shape densities (increasing difficulty).
   • mmp_enable_motor_auto: sets all motor controls to their automatic “on” mode (reducing manual difficulty).
   • mmp_disable_motor_auto: forces manual motor control by disabling the automatic mode (increasing challenge).
   • mmp_add_position_noise: applies a small random perturbation to the positions of movable shapes to increase environmental unpredictability (increasing challenge).

These MMPs are designed to operate on the minimal necessary set of states and alter a single aspect at a time without interfering with one another.

1. Skills Identification:
   • Dynamics and control adaptation: The agent must learn to modulate motor and thruster actions under different dynamics.
   • Inertia management: The agent must cope with different densities/inertias of objects.
   • Role identification and obstacle management: The agent must recognize target shapes (e.g. “ball”, “goal”) and avoid harmful elements (“lava”).
   • Action execution through manual versus automated control: The agent must decide when to rely on motor auto‐control versus manual control.

2. Minimum Necessary Set of States:
   • “Easy” states where objects are easy to move (lower density) and motor auto‐control is enabled.
   • “Hard” states where objects are heavy (increased density) and obstacles (lava) may be present.
   • Mixed states where one can test the agent’s ability to switch between automated and manual control (via the motor_auto flags).

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbations (MMPs):
   We produce a set of MMP functions that (a) reduce the challenge and (b) increase the challenge.
   • MMP “reduce density” – slightly lower polygon and circle densities to make object manipulation easier.
   • MMP “increase density” – slightly raise polygon and circle densities to make objects harder to move.
   • MMP “enable motor auto” – set the motor_auto flag to True for all joints so that the environment offers help in control.
   • MMP “disable motor auto” – force manual control by setting motor_auto to False.
   • MMP “remove lava” – remove (or neutralize) “lava” obstacles by setting their roles to a neutral role.
   • MMP “add enemy” – increase challenge by converting one randomly chosen non‐lava, non‐floor shape into a harmful “lava” obstacle.
Each MMP is atomic and applies a small perturbation based on a seeded rng key.

1. Skills that a general policy must master:
   • Motor control and actuation: Deciding when to rely on auto‐control (via motor_auto) versus manual control.
   • Obstacle management and navigation: Handling dynamic obstacles and target shapes (polygons and circles), including reacting appropriately to their presence or absence.
   • Adaptation to physical parameters: Dealing with variations in physical properties (e.g. densities, positions) that affect inertia and collision outcomes.

2. Minimum necessary set of states:
   • The motor_auto flag array within env_state (which governs auto vs. manual motor control).
   • The polygon.active (and circle.active) arrays (which indicate whether an obstacle/shape is present).
   • The polygon and circle properties (e.g. density, position) that contribute to the physical difficulty of the level.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbations (MMPs):
   We produce a set of four MMP functions. Two will “reduce the challenge” and two will “increase the challenge.”
   • Reduction MMPs:
       - mmp_enable_motor_auto: Sets all motor_auto flags to True. This reduces the need for precise motor control.
       - mmp_remove_random_polygon: Randomly deactivates one obstacle (a non-floor polygon) to simplify the scene.
   • Increase MMPs:
       - mmp_disable_motor_auto: Sets all motor_auto flags to False. This increases the control challenge.
       - mmp_add_polygon_obstacle: Randomly activates an inactive polygon slot (if available), adding an extra obstacle.
   Each MMP is written as a function that accepts an rng key and an env_state (of type EnvState) and returns a modified env_state.
   All probabilistic operations are seeded by the rng key and the functions are decorated with @jax.jit.

************************* Assistant Response3 *************************

We start by noting that a general policy must master skills in:
• Dynamically controlling motors and thrusters (e.g. regulating velocities and accelerations).
• Spatial perception and object attribution (e.g. correctly interpreting shape roles such as “goal‐like” vs “hazardous” objects).
• Collision avoidance and exploitation (e.g. managing close-proximity interactions between shapes).

Accordingly, the minimum set of relevant states are those attributes in EnvState that affect:
– The dynamics of rigid bodies (positions, velocities, angular velocities) for both polygons and circles.
– The “role” assignments of shapes (polygon_shape_roles and circle_shape_roles) as these determine reward (positive vs negative) interactions.
– The spatial configuration (positions) of rigid bodies that can be perturbed to either decrease or increase collisions.

Thus we propose four Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
1. mmp_zero_velocity: Reduces the challenge by “freezing” part of the dynamics (i.e. setting velocities and angular velocities to zero). This helps the agent in the “easy” mode.
2. mmp_reduce_negative_roles: Reduces the challenge by reassigning any roles that lead to negative rewards (for example, “hazardous” objects) to a neutral value.
3. mmp_increase_velocity: Increases the difficulty by adding random perturbations to rigid body velocities so that dynamic regulation becomes more challenging.
4. mmp_increase_collision: Increases the challenge by moving objects closer to each other (reducing distances), thereby increasing the chance of collisions and requiring more careful control.

Each MMP is defined as a JAX‐jit‐compiled function which receives an RNG key and an EnvState, and then returns an updated EnvState using immutable (functional) updates.

1. Skills required for a general policy to solve a UPOMDP sampled from this environment include:
   • Precise control over dynamics with continuous and discrete actions (e.g. motor control and thruster usage).
   • Robust collision‐avoidance and purposeful interaction with objects (e.g. managing “negative‐reward” collisions).
   • Effective exploitation of “auto‐control” modes (e.g. automatic motor activation) to mitigate challenging control dynamics.
   • Adaptability to variations in physical parameters (e.g. density, binding assignments) that affect inertia and control difficulty.

2. The minimal set of states most relevant for these skills includes:
   • States in which objects that generate negative rewards (e.g. “lava” objects with a specific role) are active.
   • States where manual motor control is required versus states where auto‐control (motor_auto flags) is enabled.
   • States where the physical properties (densities of polygons and circles) influence inertia and collision handling.
   • States where thruster bindings (and, by extension, their mapping to control outputs) are configured deterministically versus randomly.

3. Minimal Necessary Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   • Two MMP functions that reduce the difficulty:
       – mmp_disable_lava: Disables (“inactivates”) all shapes whose role equals 3 (assumed to cause negative rewards) so that collision penalties are removed.
       – mmp_enable_auto_motor: Forces all motors into an “auto” mode (by setting motor_auto to True) so that the agent need not maneuver manually.
   • Two MMP functions that increase the challenge:
       – mmp_increase_density: Increases the densities of all movable objects by a small factor (e.g. 1.2×), thus increasing inertia and making control harder.
       – mmp_randomize_thruster_binding: Randomizes the thruster binding assignments so that the agent’s learned mappings become less reliable.

Each MMP is implemented as a @jax.jit‐decorated function that accepts an rng key and the input env_state (an EnvState instance) and returns a modified env_state. They are designed to be atomic and non‐deterministically alter the environment without canceling each other’s changes.

1. Identify required skills:
   • Control precision: the policy must learn to precisely apply actions (via motors and thrusters) to move bodies.
   • Collision avoidance and management: the agent needs to navigate and react to collisions between polygons and circles.
   • Adaptation to physical parameters: the agent must understand how mass, density, and friction affect motion.
   • Obstacle management: the agent must handle the presence (or absence) of obstacles in the environment.
   • Spatial reasoning: understanding the positions of rigid bodies (polygons and circles) is key.

2. Identify a minimal necessary set of environment states:
   • Shape densities of polygons and circles – which affect inertia and movement.
   • Activation flags (active/inactive) of obstacles in polygons and circles.
   • Positions (e.g. polygon.position) of the bodies – crucial for collision and spatial planning.
   • The floor (polygon index 0) remains special and should not be arbitrarily modified.

3. Produce a minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   We start with MMPs that reduce the challenge:
     • mmp_reduce_shape_density: lowers the densities, making bodies easier to move.
     • mmp_shift_polygon_positions: slightly offset non‐floor polygons to lower collision likelihood.
     • mmp_remove_random_obstacle: deactivates a randomly chosen active obstacle (excluding the floor).
     
   Then, MMPs that increase the challenge:
     • mmp_increase_shape_density: increases the densities so bodies become harder to move.
     • mmp_add_extra_obstacle: reactivates (or “adds”) an inactive polygon as an extra obstacle.
     
   Each function operates directly on the EnvState using immutable updates and uses an rng key for probabilistic decisions. All functions are jitted.

1. Skills that a general policy must master:
   • Motor control – managing joint actuation with correct timing, whether in manual or automatic (motor_auto) mode.
   • Thruster management – using thruster activations appropriately to modify the state.
   • Collision and dynamic response – anticipating and reacting to shape interactions (via densities, friction, and mass properties).
   • Observability – extracting and using symbolic/pixel cues (e.g. highlighted shape roles) to differentiate goals from distractors.
   • Robustness to environmental physics – dealing with varied gravity, angular velocities, and inertial properties.

2. Minimum necessary set of states:
   • States where the motor control is “easier” because motors are automatically activated (motor_auto set to True) versus states where manual control is forced.
   • States with muted physics where shapes’ densities are lower (thus reducing collision penalties) versus states with exaggerated densities.
   • States with clearer visual signals – for example, with goal shapes highlighted – versus states with less obvious cues.
   • States with reduced gravity to simplify dynamics versus states with increased perturbations (e.g. elevated angular velocities) making control more challenging.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   We produce a set of five unique MMPs. Two reduce the challenge (e.g. enabling motor_auto and reducing densities, or setting gravity near zero and highlighting goal shapes) while three increase the challenge (e.g. disabling motor_auto, increasing densities, and injecting random torques).
   • mmp_reduce_difficulty: Sets all motor_auto flags to True and scales the shape densities down.
   • mmp_increase_difficulty: Forces manual motor control (motor_auto = False) and increases shape densities.
   • mmp_enhance_observability: Highlights goal shapes (those with a specific role, e.g. role==2) to make them easier to detect.
   • mmp_reduce_gravity: Sets the gravity vector (if present) to near-zero to “soften” the dynamic challenge.
   • mmp_inject_random_torque: Randomly adds an angular velocity to both polygons and circles to increase the dynamical challenge.

We first analyzed the core skills that any policy must master when interacting with a UPOMDP from this jax2d‐based kinetic physics engine:
 
1. Control of actuators:
 • The policy must learn to modulate joint motors and thrusters. In our environment, the “motor_auto” flag indicates whether joints are automatically controlled or not. Mastering the distinction between manual and automatic control is essential.
 
2. Handling physical dynamics:
 • The policy must cope with external forces such as gravity and the mass/density of the bodies. Managing collisions, momentum and friction (implicitly present within dynamics parameters) is also critical.
 
3. Spatial and collision awareness:
 • The policy must avoid unwanted collisions and exploit beneficial ones. This requires handling the collision matrix as well as detecting and reacting to shape roles.
 
From these skills we identified that the minimal set of state attributes that are especially relevant includes:
 
• The “motor_auto” flags – which decide if joint control is “easier” (auto set) or require manual control.
• The “gravity” vector – which if reduced (or set to zero) simplifies the dynamics.
• The “polygon_densities” and “circle_densities” – which affect how hard it is to move the objects.
• The “collision_matrix” – which determines the dynamics of collisions.
 
To influence the difficulty, we design six Minimal Meaningful Perturbations (MMPs). Three of them reduce the challenge:
 a. mmp_enable_motor_auto – forces all joints into automatic mode (making control easier).
 b. mmp_zero_gravity – sets gravity to zero.
 c. mmp_disable_collision – deactivates physical collisions.
 
And three that increase challenge:
 d. mmp_disable_motor_auto – forces all joints into manual mode.
 e. mmp_increase_gravity – amplifies gravity.
 f. mmp_increase_shape_density – increases the densities of shapes (making them “heavier” and harder to move).
  
Each MMP is implemented as a self-contained JAX function using @jax.jit. Each function receives a PRNGKey and an env_state (of type EnvState) and returns a modified env_state. Care is taken that operations are atomic, probabilistic elements are keyed with the provided rng, and atomic updates (using immutable “replace”) are used.
  

************************* Assistant Response8 *************************

We start by analyzing the skills that a policy must master when interacting with any POMDP generated from this UPOMDP environment. The following skills are essential:

1. Motor and Thruster Control – The agent must understand how to manage the motor actions and thruster actions in order to move its agent effectively. In particular, the “motor_auto” flag determines whether the agent is responsible for controlling the motor or whether it is automatically set to a default state.

2. Spatial Reasoning – The environment’s dynamics are defined by various shapes (polygons and circles) with assigned roles (e.g. “goal”, “ball”, “lava”, etc.). The policy must be robust to changes in the environment’s layout as these roles are critical in reward propagation.

3. Collision and Obstacle Management – The agent must cope with the presence of obstacles. These may be “removed” (making the task easier) or “activated” (increasing complexity) in a minimal manner.

4. Physical Dynamics Adjustment – Parameters such as gravity affect the difficulty of controlling bodies. Adjusting gravity can directly make the dynamics easier or more challenging.

Based on these skills, the minimum necessary set of state aspects are:
• The auto motor control flag (motor_auto) that affects control difficulty.
• The gravity vector present in the simulation’s state.
• The active/inactive status of obstacles (polygons, circles) that impact collision and spatial navigation.
• The thruster binding configuration that can affect the mapping between policy outputs and actual thruster forces.

We now produce a set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbations (MMP) functions that modify the env_state. We start with MMPs that reduce the difficulty:
1. mmp_enable_auto_motors: Force all motor joints to become “auto” (i.e. controlled automatically) so that the agent need not worry about fine motor control.
2. mmp_reduce_gravity: Reduce gravity (by zeroing or scaling it down) to simplify the dynamics.
3. mmp_remove_random_obstacle: Remove a randomly selected obstacle (non-floor polygon) from the environment to reduce the amount of collision/avoidance challenges.

Then, we provide MMPs that increase the difficulty:
4. mmp_disable_auto_motors: Force all motor joints to require manual control by setting motor_auto to False.
5. mmp_increase_gravity: Increase the effect of gravity to impose a more challenging physical dynamics.
6. mmp_increase_obstacle_density: Activate (or “add”) an extra obstacle from among inactive ones, or increase the “density” (and thus difficulty in collision handling) for a random inactive obstacle.
7. mmp_randomize_thruster_bindings: Randomly reassign thruster bindings to disrupt predictable control mappings.

Each MMP is implemented as an atomic JAX function that takes a random key and an env_state, performing a single-pass update using immutable updates (via env_state.replace) and without any iterative search. All probabilistic operations are seeded with the provided RNG key, and each function is decorated with @jax.jit.
