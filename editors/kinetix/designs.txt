We first analyze the skills that any general policy should master in order to solve a POMDP sampled from this UPOMDP environment:
 • Motor control: The policy must learn how to coordinate joint actions and thruster actions. In particular, it must learn to adjust when motors are automatically set (via motor_auto) versus when the agent needs to control them manually.
 • Object manipulation and navigation: The policy must understand the spatial arrangement of environments. In our simulation the positions of dynamic rigid bodies (polygons and circles) are critical since collision‐avoidance and contact interactions (for rewards or penalties) are computed based on their positions.
 • Collision management: The policy must deal with contacts between shapes and adjust its behavior when collisions occur or are about to occur.

Accordingly, the minimal set of states we need to modify are:
 1. The “motor_auto” flags (in EnvState) that determine if joint motors are automatically actuated.
 2. The positions of shapes (both polygon and circle positions contained in env_state.polygon.position and env_state.circle.position) which affect collision likelihood.
 3. (Optionally) Other physical parameters such as densities that affect the dynamics.

Based on these observations, we design a minimal necessary set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions. Two of these reduce the challenge while two increase the challenge:
 • mmp_reduce_control_difficulty: Sets all motor_auto flags to True, so the agent does not have to control motors manually.
 • mmp_separate_shapes: Slightly translates the positions of the shapes away from the origin (or in opposing directions) to reduce the likelihood of collisions.
 • mmp_increase_control_difficulty: Sets all motor_auto flags to False, forcing the agent to perform manual control.
 • mmp_collide_shapes: Scales the positions of shapes towards the origin, increasing the chance of collisions.

Each MMP function is implemented as an atomic edit using a single pass update and uses jax.jit for efficiency. All randomness is seeded from an rng key.

1. Skills required for mastering the UPOMDP:
   • Motor and thruster control – the agent must learn to coordinate joint actions and thruster commands.
   • Adaptation to physical dynamics – the ability to cope with variations in inertia and density of objects.
   • Obstacle navigation – detecting and avoiding (or exploiting) obstacles that can interfere with motion.
   • Strategic exploration – deciding when to leverage “automatic” controls (or disable them) and when to manipulate the environment.

2. Minimal set of states to be harnessed:
   • The motor control flags (env_state.motor_auto) which determine if joint actions are automatic.
   • The physical properties of objects such as polygon_densities and circle_densities.
   • The active status of obstacles, as given by the “active” flags for polygons (env_state.polygon.active) and circles.
   • (Optionally) the structure of the environment as given by elements like thruster_bindings, although we focus on the above for minimal perturbations.

3. Minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   • MMPs that reduce the challenge:
       - mmp_ease_motor_control: forces motor_auto to True, easing motor control.
       - mmp_reduce_shape_densities: lowers densities (mass/inertia) of shapes so they are easier to move.
       - mmp_remove_random_obstacle: deactivates one non‐floor obstacle (removing an obstacle).
   • MMPs that increase the challenge:
       - mmp_harden_motor_control: forces motor_auto to False, requiring explicit motor control.
       - mmp_increase_shape_densities: increases densities (mass/inertia) making objects tougher to manipulate.
       - mmp_add_extra_obstacle: activates a currently inactive obstacle (adding an obstacle).

Each function is written as a self-contained JAX-jitted function that takes an rng key and an EnvState and returns the modified EnvState.

1. Skills to master:
   • Motor/thruster coordination: The policy must learn when to let motors run automatically versus when to command them manually.
   • Obstacle and collision management: The policy must navigate a dynamic environment with many shapes (polygons and circles) that might cause collisions and influence rewards.
   • Physical property management: The policy must cope with differing body densities which affect inertia and overall dynamics.
   • Timing and reward–based behavior: Recognizing key states (e.g. when goal/collision conditions change) to trigger proper actions.

2. Minimal necessary states:
   • Motor control state (env_state.motor_auto): Determines whether joints are under auto control.
   • Obstacle state (e.g. env_state.polygon.active): Indicates which obstacles are active in the environment.
   • Physical properties (env_state.polygon_densities and env_state.circle_densities): Influence how bodies interact and respond to forces.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   • MMPs that reduce the challenge:
       - mmp_easier_motor_control: Set all motor_auto flags to True so the agent does not need to control each motor manually.
       - mmp_remove_random_obstacle: Randomly deactivate one non‐essential (non–floor) polygon, reducing environmental clutter.
   • MMPs that increase the challenge:
       - mmp_increase_density: Increase densities of polygons and circles to make the dynamics stiffer and collisions more punishing.
       - mmp_disable_auto_motor: Set all motor_auto flags to False so that the policy must manually control every joint.
       
Each MMP is implemented as a JAX–jitted function that uses the provided rng key for stochastic decisions and returns the minimally perturbed env_state.

************************* Assistant Response3 *************************

1. Skills and Challenges:
   • A general policy must learn to (a) control motors and thrusters for coordinated movement, (b) navigate a partially observable space with multiple types of objects (goals, obstacles, hazards), and (c) react to collision‐based events.
   • This requires mastering continuous control, strategic planning (e.g. reaching the goal while avoiding “lava” obstacles), and managing dynamic properties (such as densities and sizes) that affect the physics simulation.

2. Relevant State Subsets:
   • Shape roles (stored in env_state.polygon_shape_roles and env_state.circle_shape_roles) that designate the function of objects (e.g. goal, lava, normal).
   • Dynamic parameters such as densities (env_state.polygon_densities, env_state.circle_densities) that influence stability and inertia.
   • Geometric parameters (e.g. positions and, when available, vertex sizes in the polygon attribute) that affect collision and accessibility.
   • Active flags (e.g. shape.active inside sim_state) that determine which objects are in play.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) Functions:
   To cover the above skills, we provide six unique MMPs. The first three reduce the environment’s challenge (making it easier for the policy), and the remaining three increase the difficulty:
   • mmp_reduce_lava: Finds one hazardous (“lava”, role 3) polygon and converts its role to “normal” (role 0), reducing penalty.
   • mmp_increase_goal_size: Finds the goal object (role 2) and slightly scales up its geometric size (e.g. its vertices) to make it easier to reach.
   • mmp_lower_density: Decreases the physical density of non-goal objects (e.g. obstacles) to reduce inertia and simplify control.
   • mmp_increase_lava: Finds one normal (“benign”, role 0) polygon and converts its role to “lava” (role 3) to add more hazardous obstacles.
   • mmp_reduce_goal_size: Finds the goal object (role 2) and slightly scales down its size to make it harder to contact.
   • mmp_increase_density: Increases densities of non-goal objects to increase inertia and thereby the physical challenge.
Each MMP is implemented as a @jax.jit‐decorated function that takes in a JAX RNG key and an env_state, applies a minimal, localized (atomic) modification, and returns the updated env_state.

Step 1. Identify key skills that a general policy must master:
  • Motor control: coordinating joint actions appropriately.
  • Thruster control: timing and using thrusters to affect motion.
  • Dynamic interaction with objects: managing collisions and avoiding dense obstacles.
  • Adaptation to partially observable conditions: responding to changes in state (e.g. roles of shapes, physics dynamics).

Step 2. Identify a minimal necessary set of states that are most relevant:
  • The “motor_auto” configuration state: whether joints are automatically controlled or require explicit actions.
  • The densities of polygons and circles: these affect the mass/inertia properties and hence challenge in controlling objects.
  • Other physical parameters (e.g. friction, collision‐related parameters) could be considered, but here we focus on the state fields that are most directly modifiable in our UPOMDP: motor_auto and shape densities.

Step 3. Propose a minimal necessary set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
  • mmp_reduce_motor_difficulty – “eases” the motor control challenge by forcing all joints to be in the automatic mode (motor_auto = True), thereby relieving the agent from having to fine control every joint.
  • mmp_increase_motor_difficulty – “raises” the motor control challenge by disabling automatic control (motor_auto = False) so that the agent must explicitly control each motor.
  • mmp_reduce_obstacle_difficulty – “eases” the physical interaction challenge by slightly reducing the densities of polygons and circles, making them lighter and easier to move.
  • mmp_increase_obstacle_difficulty – “raises” the physical interaction challenge by slightly increasing the densities of polygons and circles, thereby making them heavier and more resistant to movement.

Each of these functions is implemented as an atomic operation using JAX’s immutable updates (via .replace) and decorated with @jax.jit. The rng key is used for probabilistic seeding even if the perturbations here are deterministic, to standardize the function signatures for external use.


************************* Assistant Response5 *************************

We first analyze the skills a “general” policy must master to solve any POMDP sampled from our UPOMDP environment. In our context the policy must learn (a) to control motors and thrusters appropriately, (b) to interpret and interact with objects whose “roles” produce positive (goal‐related) rewards or negative (penalty) rewards upon collisions, (c) to deal with dynamic object interactions (collisions, movement, friction, inertia) and (d) effectively manage partial observability.

For example, the policy must master:
• Motor and thruster control – deciding when to use the auto‐control mode or manually control individual actuators.
• Navigation among obstacles – knowing how to handle objects that produce reward or penalty on collision.
• Adaptive physics management – handling cases (for example via shape densities, positions, or activations) that change the difficulty of collisions and the environment.

Based on those required skills we identify a minimum necessary set of “states” to sample:
1. States where the agent has many controlled motors versus states where many motors are set to auto (which simplify the control problem).
2. States having various levels of “physical challenge” – which can be modified by changing the densities (and thus the inertial properties) of the dynamic shapes.
3. States with extra obstacles active (e.g. “penalty” obstacles) versus states where an obstacle is removed.
4. States where the spatial arrangement of obstacles is “challenging” (object positions are close to each other, increasing the chance of collisions) versus ones that are more separated.

We now propose a minimal set of five Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions that modify the env_state at the most atomic level:
1. mmp_enable_auto_control – slightly reduces the control difficulty by setting all motor_auto flags to True.
2. mmp_disable_auto_control – slightly increases the control challenge by “disabling” auto control (setting motor_auto to False).
3. mmp_reduce_density – reduces the physical “weight” (density) of polygons and circles to ease collisions.
4. mmp_deactivate_obstacle – reduces the challenge by deactivating one (non‐floor) obstacle (i.e. setting its active flag to False).
5. mmp_move_obstacle_closer – increases the challenge by repositioning one obstacle closer to the “floor” (or to a reference point), thus increasing collision likelihood.

Each MMP is implemented as a @jax.jit function using only the provided rng and the env_state. They employ immutable updates via “at” indexing and masking while using operations from jax and chex.


************************* Assistant Response6 *************************

1. Analysis of Skills and Relevant States:
   • A policy must learn to control joint motors and thrusters to navigate the underlying physics.
   • It must understand collision dynamics between polygons and circles, especially when certain roles (e.g. floor, goal, obstacles) come into play.
   • It has to cope with different inertial properties (densities) and the effects of gravity.
   • It must decide when to “ignore” distractor shapes versus when to use them (or avoid them) to reach the reward.

   Minimum necessary set of states:
   • States where non‐essential polygonal shapes (obstacles) are active.
   • States where non‐essential circular shapes are active.
   • States with relatively benign dynamics (i.e. lower gravity, easier motor control).
   • States where additional obstacles can be introduced to increase difficulty.

2. Minimal Meaningful Perturbations (MMPs):
   We provide four perturbations. Two MMP functions reduce challenge while two increase challenge. They are defined as follows:

   a. mmp_deactivate_polygon:
      – Reduces difficulty by deactivating one distractor polygon (except the floor, assumed to be index 0).
      – This targets states containing unnecessary obstacles that could hinder smooth control.

   b. mmp_deactivate_circle:
      – Similar to the first but for circular shapes, reducing potential distraction.

   c. mmp_activate_polygon:
      – Increases difficulty by activating an inactive polygon slot (if available) and marking it as an obstacle.
      – This forces the agent to deal with an extra obstacle in its dynamics.

   d. mmp_increase_gravity:
      – Increases difficulty by slightly increasing the gravitational acceleration.
      – Stronger gravity makes the dynamics stiffer and control more challenging.

   Each MMP is implemented as a minimal atomic perturbation using JAX primitives. They receive an RNG key and an env_state, perform a single choice using rng-seeded probabilistic operations, and return a new env_state.

1. Skills a general policy must master:
   • Perception and state estimation: Interpreting symbolic/pixel/entity observations.
   • Motor control: Coordinating joint motors and thrusters to enact precise movements.
   • Collision avoidance and recovery: Understanding the dynamics (e.g. shape collisions and manifold feedback) and reacting properly.
   • Exploiting reward structure: Recognizing when reward‐triggering events occur (e.g. aligning roles, achieving proximity goals).

2. Minimum necessary set of states:
   • A “clean” state with minimal obstacles (few non‐floor shapes active, zero velocities, simple geometry).
   • A “cluttered” state with additional obstacles (more active shapes, higher density values making collisions more punishing).
   • A state where the control difficulty is modulated, for instance by the status of motor_auto (either letting the agent control each joint or automating some joints).
   • A state with diversified dynamics where objects have nonzero velocities versus one with “frozen” dynamics.

3. Minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbations (MMPs):
   • MMP functions that reduce the challenge:
       – mmp_disable_obstacle: Randomly deactivates one non‐floor polygon, removing a potential obstacle.
       – mmp_zero_velocities: Sets all velocities and angular velocities (for both polygons and circles) to zero to simplify dynamics.
       – mmp_enable_motor_auto: Sets all motor_auto flags to True, thus reducing the need for fine motor control.
   • MMP functions that increase the challenge:
       – mmp_increase_density: Increases the density of a selected (non‐floor) polygon (e.g. doubling it) in order to stiffen dynamics and heighten collision effects.
       – mmp_activate_extra_obstacle: Randomly reactivates one inactive obstacle (non‐floor polygon) to add clutter.
       – mmp_disable_motor_auto: Sets all motor_auto flags to False, requiring the agent to control all joints manually.
Each MMP performs a minimal atomic update using a single probabilistic decision (via the rng key) and an immutable update to the env_state. They are unique and do not cancel each other deterministically.

************************* Assistant Response8 *************************
[PLAN STARTS HERE]
Identify core skills that any general policy must master for these UPOMDPs:
  • Motor/Thruster Control: The agent must learn to control joint (motor) and thruster actions to navigate and manipulate the environment.
  • Spatial and Role Reasoning: The agent must reason about the spatial configuration and roles of shapes (e.g. “ball”, “goal”, “hazard”) to exploit positive collisions or avoid negative ones.
  • Collision and Interaction Management: The agent must manipulate objects so that collisions produce reward (or avoid negative outcomes).

From these skills, the minimal necessary set of states is:
  1. A state with a reward‐favorable configuration (e.g. one shape is “ball” and another “goal”) so that the agent can more easily receive positive reward.
  2. A state where motor controls are “assisted” (via the motor_auto flag) making the control problem easier.
  3. A state with a hazardous (or penalizing) configuration (e.g. one shape set to “hazard”) to force the agent to learn avoidance.
  4. A state where motor assistance is disabled, requiring the agent to provide explicit joint actions.

Based on these minimal states, we produce four Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions.
Two perturbations reduce difficulty:
  • mmp_reduce_reward_setup: force a favorable role assignment so that the first polygon is “ball” (role 1) and the second is “goal” (role 2).
  • mmp_reduce_motor_assist: set motor_auto flags to True so that motors are automatically controlled.
Two perturbations increase difficulty:
  • mmp_increase_hazard_setup: force a hazardous role (role 3) on one shape (the second polygon) to create a negative reward potential.
  • mmp_increase_motor_challenge: disable motor assistance (set motor_auto flags to False) so that the agent must control all motors explicitly.
Each function is implemented in JAX (using @jax.jit) and uses the rng for any stochastic operations.

1. Skills that a general policy must master:
   • Efficient spatial reasoning and collision avoidance: the policy must control the positioning of shapes, navigate the physical layout, and handle collisions.
   • Role–reward association: the policy needs to learn how different shape roles affect rewards (e.g. interactions between shapes with roles 1, 2, or 3).
   • Dynamic control management: handling joint and thruster actions as well as auto‐controls to shape the dynamics.
   • Sensitivity to physical parameters: such as densities that indirectly affect inertia and the overall physical “feel” of interactions.

2. Minimum necessary set of states (aspects) to edit:
   • Shape positions (in the “polygon” and “circle” attributes of the state) that determine collision frequencies.
   • Shape roles (polygon_shape_roles and circle_shape_roles) that govern reward computations.
   • Densities (polygon_densities and circle_densities) that alter dynamic responses.
   • (Optionally) Motor auto flags, though we will focus on the physical state aspects.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   We construct six MMP functions. Three will reduce the environmental challenge while three will increase it.
   – Reducing challenge:
     a. mmp_increase_spacing: Moves active shapes further apart (reducing collisions).
     b. mmp_reduce_negative_roles: Reassigns “negative” roles (role 3) to “safer” roles (role 2) so collisions are less penalized.
     c. mmp_lower_density: Lowers the densities of shapes, making impacts less punishing.
   – Increasing challenge:
     d. mmp_decrease_spacing: Moves shapes closer together (thereby increasing collision rates).
     e. mmp_increase_negative_roles: Randomly converts some safe roles (role 2) into “negative” roles (role 3).
     f. mmp_higher_density: Increases shape densities so that collisions and dynamics become more severe.

Each MMP function is implemented as a @jax.jit function, uses the provided rng key for any probabilistic choices, and modifies the immutable env_state via its replace method.
