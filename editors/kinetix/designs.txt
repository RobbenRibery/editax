1. Skills Identification:
   • Motor and Thruster Control – The policy must learn to manage motor commands (including whether joints are auto‐controlled or not) and thruster commands for proper movement.
   • Collision and Dynamics Handling – The policy must infer and react to contact events and the dynamics of rigid bodies (polygons and circles) when interacting.
   • Environmental Perception – The policy needs to correctly interpret state information such as shape roles, densities, and simulated physics properties.
   • Adaptation to Varying Difficulty – The policy must perform under simplified conditions (easier control, lighter densities, less clutter) as well as in more challenging settings (active motor control, higher densities, additional obstacles).

2. Minimum Necessary Set of States:
   • “Easy‐Control” state: Motor auto‐control is enabled, so the need for precise motor command adjustments is reduced.
   • “Low Density” state: Shapes (both polygons and circles) have lower densities, making dynamics less “stiff” and collisions milder.
   • “Simplified Contact” state: Friction or collision effects are lessened, resulting in a less punishing environment upon collisions.
   • “Challenging Motor” state: Motor auto‐control is disabled and motor commands become critical.
   • “High Density” state: Shapes have increased densities meaning that collisions and inertia are more significant.
   • “Obstacle Filled” state: An additional (previously inactive) shape is activated as an obstacle, increasing task complexity.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) Functions:
   – Group A (Reducing challenge):
     • mmp_reduce_motor_control: Set all joints to auto (motor_auto true).
     • mmp_reduce_shape_density: Reduce densities for both polygons and circles.
     • mmp_simplify_collision: Lower friction coefficients within rigid bodies so that collisions are less severe.
   – Group B (Increasing challenge):
     • mmp_increase_motor_difficulty: Disable motor_auto to force active control.
     • mmp_increase_shape_density: Increase densities to intensify inertia and collision effects.
     • mmp_add_random_obstacle: Activate one inactive shape (e.g. a polygon) to add an extra obstacle.
Each MMP function uses the supplied RNG key for any probabilistic choice and performs a single atomic change.

1. Skills for a General Policy:
   • Spatial reasoning and navigation: The agent must understand the layout of the environment, including the positions and roles of different shapes (e.g. floor, goal, hazard) and use that information to plan motion.
   • Object manipulation and interaction: The agent must control motors and thrusters to move objects, overcome inertia, and interact with environmental elements.
   • Timing/Sequencing and control adaptation: The policy must correctly sequence motor and thruster commands even when observations are incomplete.
   • Robustness to variability: The agent must handle variability in physical properties (e.g. densities, friction) and positions.

2. Minimum Necessary States:
   • State of dynamic bodies: Positions and densities of polygons and circles that represent objects; these affect inertia and collision dynamics.
   • Motor control state: The binary motor_auto flag array and motor_bindings which indicate which joints are being actively controlled versus automatically set.
   • Environmental layout: The arrangement (positions) of shapes that define the spatial challenge.
   • Thruster configuration: The thruster_bindings that determine how thrusters are applied.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) Functions:
   We construct a set of four distinct MMP functions.
   • Two “easier” MMPs:
       - mmp_reduce_inertia: Slight reduction of density values (for polygons and circles) so that objects are easier to move.
       - mmp_promote_motor_auto: Increase the fraction of joints with automatic control, reducing the need for precise motor control.
   • Two “harder” MMPs:
       - mmp_shuffle_positions: Apply a small random perturbation to the positions of dynamic objects (polygons and circles) so that the environment becomes less predictable.
       - mmp_increase_density: Slightly increase density values to make the objects heavier and harder to move.
       
Each function takes an RNG key and env_state (an instance of EnvState) and returns an updated env_state. All probabilistic operations use the provided RNG key and each function is decorated with @jax.jit.

1. Skills to master:
   • Recognizing and controlling object physical properties (densities) to manage collisions.
   • Modulating motor control settings (motor_auto) to simplify or complicate control.
   • Processing spatial information by positioning shapes appropriately, e.g. bringing goals closer or pushing objects further apart.
   • Managing the interplay between object positions and dynamics for collision avoidance and proper contact.

2. Minimal necessary set of states:
   • States where object densities affect collision dynamics.
   • States where control flags (motor_auto) simplify or complicate motor actions.
   • States where relative positions of key shapes (e.g. the “goal” shape with role 2) matter for successful navigation/control.

3. Minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbations (MMPs):
   • Three MMPs that reduce the challenge:
       – mmp_reduce_density: slightly reduce densities so collisions are less punishing.
       – mmp_relax_motor_control: force automatic motor control (set motor_auto to True) to ease control.
       – mmp_move_goal_closer: if a goal shape (role 2) is present, slightly move it closer to the center.
   • Three MMPs that increase the challenge:
       – mmp_increase_density: slightly increase densities, making collisions stiffer.
       – mmp_disable_motor_auto: force manual motor control (set motor_auto to False) to demand more precise handling.
       – mmp_spread_shapes: move shapes further away from the center to increase navigation difficulty.

The UPOMDP we are given requires that a general policy be able to:
• Control its body in an environment with under‐specified dynamics, i.e. managing the physics (gravity, mass/inertia) and the mapping of actions (motor and thruster bindings) to movements.
• Interpret partially observed states (e.g. polygon and circle roles, densities, collisions) to plan appropriate control actions.
• Balance exploration with goal‐directed behavior under constraints such as collisions and role‐based rewards.

In order to succeed, a policy must master the following skills:
1. Robust control under uncertain dynamics – managing gravity and inertia.
2. Exploiting motor “auto” settings to ease low-level control.
3. Sensory integration from shape properties (densities and roles) that impact collision and reward signals.
4. Adapting to changes in physical parameters (such as shape densities) that affect mass/inertia and collision behavior.

A minimum necessary set of state aspects (features of env_state) relevant for these skills include:
• Gravity (affecting dynamic difficulty).
• Polygon and circle densities (affecting mass/inertia and collision responses).
• Motor auto flags (affecting the ease of control).
• (Optionally) Other physical parameters contained in env_state that influence the difficulty of control and collision avoidance.

Accordingly, we propose a minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions which perform slightest modifications on these features. We start with modifications that reduce the challenge (e.g. lowering gravity, reducing densities, or enabling automatic motor controls) and then perturb the state to increase the challenge (e.g. increasing gravity or increasing shape densities). Each function uses JAX’s jit compilation and consumes a PRNGKey to seed its (potentially probabilistic) operation.

The MMP functions are:
1. mmp_reduce_gravity_easier – scales down the gravity vector to ease control.
2. mmp_increase_gravity_harder – scales up the gravity to increase inertial effects.
3. mmp_reduce_shape_density_easier – lowers densities for both polygons and circles so that collisions are milder.
4. mmp_increase_shape_density_harder – increases densities to make dynamics more demanding.
5. mmp_enable_motor_auto_easier – sets all motor_auto flags to True so that joint actions are automatically enabled.

Each function performs a minimal atomic update to env_state and returns the modified state.

1. Identify required skills:
   • Trajectory control and dynamic stabilization: The agent must learn to control joint actuations and thruster outputs.
   • Inertia management: Mastering the physics of moving bodies requires proper handling of mass (via densities) and inertia.
   • Exploiting auto‐control vs. manual control: The agent must learn when autonomous motor control (motor_auto flag) helps or hinders performance.
   • Robust spatial reasoning: The agent must predict and avoid collisions; thus, the placement of shapes matters.

2. Relevant state components:
   • polygon_densities and circle_densities – affecting mass/inertia.
   • motor_auto flag – influences the need to control motors manually.
   • polygon.position and circle.position – spatial layout which affects collisions.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   We design five distinct MMP functions. Two reduce the challenge, and three increase it.
   • mmp_reduce_inertia:
       – Lowers densities of all active shapes (both polygons and circles), reducing inertia and making control easier.
   • mmp_increase_inertia:
       – Increases densities of active shapes to raise inertia and make stabilization more challenging.
   • mmp_enable_motor_auto:
       – Enables automatic motor control on all joints by setting motor_auto to True; reducing control complexity.
   • mmp_disable_motor_auto:
       – Disables automatic control (motor_auto = False), increasing the need for precise control from the agent.
   • mmp_offset_positions:
       – Shifts the positions of active shapes by a small random offset to slightly alter collision geometry.
   Each function uses a single rng split attempt and immutable updates on env_state.

1. Skills Required:
   • Perception under partial observability: The policy must accurately infer hidden state variables from partial observations.
   • Fine motor control: The policy must master joint and thruster actions (both continuous and discrete) to control the bodies.
   • Dynamic adaptation: The policy must deal with physical interactions such as collisions, friction and gravity, adapting its behavior to diverse dynamics.
   • Strategic planning: The agent should cope with variations in body configurations—e.g. shape positions—and adjust to changes in automatic versus manual control.

2. Minimum Necessary Set of States:
   • Physical dynamics parameters (e.g. gravity and friction) which directly affect how bodies move and collide.
   • Motor control flags (the “motor_auto” boolean array) that determine whether joints are controlled automatically or manually.
   • Position and physical properties (stored in the polygon and circle sub‐states) because they shape collision and contact events.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) Functions:
   We'll define a set of atomic MMP functions. Starting with ones that reduce the challenge (making the environment “easier”) and then gradually ones that increase the challenge.
   • Reduce difficulty:
       – mmp_lower_gravity: Lowers gravity by 20%.
       – mmp_enable_motor_auto: Sets the motor_auto flags to True (helping the policy by automatically controlling joints).
       – mmp_increase_friction: Increases friction coefficients in both polygon and circle bodies (damping motion and collisions).
   • Increase difficulty:
       – mmp_raise_gravity: Raises gravity by 20%.
       – mmp_disable_motor_auto: Sets the motor_auto flags to False (forcing the policy to control joints manually).
       – mmp_reduce_friction: Reduces friction coefficients in both polygon and circle bodies (increasing slippage and instability).
       – mmp_offset_shapes: Slightly perturbs the positions of bodies (increasing unpredictability of collisions).

Each MMP is implemented as a single JAX‐jit–compiled function that receives an rng key and an env_state (of type EnvState) and returns a modified env_state. All probabilistic operations are seeded by the rng key. These atomic modifications are designed not to cancel each other deterministically.

Our analysis of the UPOMDP indicates that any general policy must be robust in the following skills:
1. Handling changes in physics dynamics – in particular, adapting to different gravity magnitudes that affect object accelerations and overall dynamical difficulty.
2. Managing inertial properties – a policy must master control when objects have different mass-related characteristics. Modifying shape densities changes both mass and inertia and thereby the dynamics.
3. Recognizing and reasoning with shape “roles” – different shapes have roles (encoded as integers) that affect the reward structure via collisions. A policy must be sensitive to these role assignments.

From these observations, we determine that the minimal state components to exercise these skills are:
• The environment’s gravity vector (or magnitude) contained in the simulation state.
• The densities of the active polygon and circle bodies.
• The shape roles for both polygons and circles.

Based on these minimal state components, we design the following set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
1. mmp_reduce_gravity – Reduces the magnitude of gravity by a fixed factor (e.g. 0.5×) to simplify the dynamics.
2. mmp_increase_gravity – Increases the magnitude of gravity (e.g. 1.5×) to make the dynamics more challenging.
3. mmp_lower_shape_density – Lowers the densities of all active shapes by a small factor, making them “lighter” and easier to manipulate.
4. mmp_raise_shape_density – Raises the densities of all active shapes by a small factor, increasing inertia and thus the difficulty in control.
5. mmp_simplify_roles – Sets both polygon and circle roles to a uniform “easy” role (e.g. 1) so that reward conditions become less conflicting.
6. mmp_randomize_roles – Randomly reassigns roles among the available options (using the available range, e.g. 0–3). The randomness could generate more “conflicting” assignments and thus a more challenging scenario.

Each function is written as a self-contained JAX function decorated with @jax.jit. They take a PRNG key and env_state (of type EnvState) as inputs and return a perturbed env_state. All probabilistic operations are seeded with the provided rng key.

1. Skills Identification:
   • Motor Control: The policy must learn to coordinate motors and thrusters. In our UPOMDP, it is essential to correctly leverage the “motor_auto” flag in order to handle joint actuation.
   • Physics Interaction: The policy must understand and work with the physical properties of objects. In our state, the polygon and circle densities affect inertia and responsiveness and thus are key to mastering dynamics.
   • Perception: The policy needs to interpret the roles and visual features (e.g. highlighted shapes) to extract task-relevant cues.

2. Minimal Necessary Set of States:
   • motor_auto – for controlling whether the joints are automatically set.
   • polygon_densities and circle_densities – govern the mass/inertia properties and thereby the stability of objects.
   • polygon_highlighted and circle_highlighted – assist perception, although here we use them in a minimal way.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) Functions:
   ◦ mmp_ease_control – Reduces the challenge by setting all motor_auto flags to True so that motors are automatically “helped” (easier control).
   ◦ mmp_ease_physics – Reduces the challenge by increasing the densities of all polygons and circles (which can yield more stable, less jittery dynamics).
   ◦ mmp_increase_control_difficulty – Increases the challenge by setting motor_auto to False (forcing the policy to control all joints directly).
   ◦ mmp_increase_physics_difficulty – Increases the challenge by reducing the densities (making objects more sensitive and fast‐moving, hence harder to control).

Each MMP function is implemented as a @jax.jit function that takes an rng key (for probabilistic operations) and an env_state (of type EnvState) as inputs and returns a modified env_state. These functions perform one atomic perturbation each and do not deterministically cancel one another.

1. Skills required for a general policy:
   • Perceiving and representing relevant physical properties – e.g. positions, densities, shape roles.
   • Using reward–related cues by identifying “good” (e.g. ball/goal) and “bad” (e.g. ball/lava) shape roles.
   • Handling dynamic control under varied inertia and collision properties.
   • Adapting control to changes in physical parameters (density as a proxy for mass/inertia) and object properties.

2. Minimal necessary set of states:
   • Shape roles (polygon_shape_roles and circle_shape_roles) – these affect rewards when objects interact.
   • Physical densities (polygon_densities and circle_densities) – these affect inertia and collision dynamics.
   • Active flags of objects (e.g. polygon.active) – to ensure only active objects are modified.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   We provide four MMPs:
   • Two that reduce the environment’s challenge:
       - mmp_reduce_reward_challenge: Force at least one pair of active polygon objects to have “reward‐positive” roles (i.e. one with role 1 (“ball”) and one with role 2 (“goal”)).
       - mmp_reduce_density: Reduce the density of polygons and circles by a scaling factor (e.g. 0.5) so that dynamics become “lighter” (easier to control).
   • Two that increase the challenge:
       - mmp_increase_reward_penalty: Force a “challenging” role pairing by setting one polygon to role 1 and a second polygon to role 3 – which (by the reward rule) yields a negative product (i.e. 1*3==3).
       - mmp_increase_density: Increase the density of polygons and circles by a factor (e.g. 2.0) so that higher inertia makes control harder.
Each MMP is a minimal, atomic edit on the environment state that does not cancel out the others.

************************* Assistant Response9 *************************

The overall design is as follows:

1. Identify the key skills a general policy must master:
   • Precise motor control: the agent must command motors and thrusters to move the bodies.
   • Obstacle negotiation: the agent must navigate a complex scene composed of polygons and circles with various densities and roles.
   • Perceptual reasoning: the agent must recognize the “goal” (typically embedded in a particular shape role) and differentiate it from distractors.

2. Identify a minimal necessary set of states that are most relevant to mastering these skills:
   • “Motor state”: represented by the env_state.motor_auto array. Perturbations here can help by either alleviating or increasing the burden on motor control.
   • “Obstacle state”: represented by the polygon_densities and circle_densities arrays. These affect the difficulty of collisions and dynamics.
   • “Goal visibility state”: represented by the polygon_highlighted (and/or circle_highlighted) arrays that can highlight goal structures (assumed here to be shapes with role == 2).

3. Produce a minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions.
   • To reduce the challenge:
       - mmp_enable_motor_auto: Randomly set a high fraction of motors to “auto” (i.e. motor_auto becomes True) so that the agent does not need to control those joints.
       - mmp_reduce_obstacle_density: Lower the densities of obstacles slightly (both polygons and circles), making collisions less punishing.
       - mmp_highlight_goal: Force the “goal” shapes (here assumed to be those with polygon_shape_roles==2) to be highlighted, thereby easing perception.
   • To increase the challenge:
       - mmp_disable_motor_auto: Set all the motor_auto flags to False so that the agent must control all joints.
       - mmp_increase_obstacle_density: Increase the densities of obstacles modestly (both polygons and circles) to create more challenging collision dynamics.
       - mmp_dim_goal: Remove the highlight from goal shapes so that the agent’s perception of the goal is less obvious.

Each MMP is implemented as a minimal, atomic, deterministic perturbation function that uses one probabilistic decision (if needed) seeded by the input rng and returns the modified env_state.

The implementation uses JAX’s immutable update style (via .replace and masking via jnp.where) and applies @jax.jit to each function.
