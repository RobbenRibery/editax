1. Skills and their corresponding minimal necessary states:
   • Control of actuators: The policy must learn how to handle motors and thrusters. In particular, it must deal with the autonomous mode (motor_auto) versus manual control.
   • Obstacle management and collision avoidance: The policy must manage interactions among polygons and circles—some of which are “obstacles” that can either aid or impede progress.
   • Mass and inertia handling: The agent must learn to deal with objects having different densities (affecting mass/inertia) that influence dynamics and the ability to modify state through actions.
   • Sensor and environment exploration: The agent must cope with partially observed aspects (e.g. which shapes are active and their roles) and learn to focus on relevant features.

2. Minimum necessary set of states:
   • A state with active obstacles (polygons and circles) that can be selectively removed or re-enabled.
   • A state where the motor control mode (motor_auto) can be switched between auto‐ and manual modes.
   • A state where object densities (i.e. mass/inertia properties) vary, affecting how easy or hard it is to move objects.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   We will design four unique MMP functions. Two will reduce the challenge and two will increase it.
   • mmp_disable_random_polygon – reduces challenge by removing one active polygon obstacle.
   • mmp_enable_motor_auto – reduces challenge by turning on motor auto‐control (setting all motor_auto flags to True).
   • mmp_heavy_polygon – increases challenge by making one active polygon “heavier” (i.e. increasing its density).
   • mmp_disable_motor_auto – increases challenge by disabling auto‐control (setting motor_auto flags to False).

Each function uses @jax.jit and is fully seeded by an rng key. They directly update the env_state using immutable updates (via .replace) and simple masking operations.

We first identify that a policy in these UPOMDP environments must master several core skills:
1. Perception and state–estimation (e.g. interpreting pixel, symbolic, or entity observations).
2. Motor control (coordinating joint and thruster actions, especially under partial control when motor_auto may be active or not).
3. Spatial reasoning and collision avoidance (managing the positions, roles, and densities of shapes in a dynamic physics simulation).
4. Timing and reactive control (reacting to environment updates where rewards depend on precise collisions and interactions).

The minimum necessary set of states relevant to these skills includes:
• States where shape roles determine rewards: differences between “positive” roles (e.g. role 1 or 2 that yield rewards) and “negative” roles (e.g. role 3 that trigger penalties).
• States where the motor control flag (motor_auto) is either enabled or disabled, affecting the degree of control required.
• States where the relative positions of dynamic bodies (polygons and circles) affect the difficulty in avoiding unwanted collisions.

Accordingly, we produce a set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions. We begin with MMPs that reduce the challenge:
• mmp_enable_motor_auto – force the motor control to be automatic, reducing control demands.
• mmp_reduce_negative_roles – change roles that trigger negative rewards (e.g. role 3) into easier ones (role 1).
• mmp_increase_separation – scale up the positions of shapes to increase their separation, thus lowering collision difficulty.

Then we produce MMPs that increase the challenge:
• mmp_disable_motor_auto – disable automatic control, forcing the policy to actively control all joints.
• mmp_increase_negative_roles – with some probability, convert “neutral/positive” roles into challenging negative roles.
• mmp_cluster_shapes – scale down shape positions toward the origin to cluster objects and increase collision likelihood.

Each MMP is written as a self-contained JAX function decorated with @jax.jit. Each uses a given RNG to drive any probabilistic operations and performs a single, atomic perturbation without interfering deterministically with the others.

The overall goal is to design a set of minimal meaningful perturbations (MMPs) that slightly modify an input UPOMDP (represented by an EnvState) so that a policy learning in such environments must master several key skills. In our context, a general policy must:

1. Perceive and interpret observations that can be in pixels, symbolic, entity forms, or even “blind” (timestep‐only) representations.
2. Understand and act with different control modes (continuous, discrete, multidiscrete) that affect both joint motors and thrusters.
3. Manage interactions with dynamic obstacles (polygons and circles), including handling collisions and changes in physical properties.
4. Discriminate between different “roles” assigned to shapes (e.g., goal, ball, or hazardous element) which affect the reward structure.

To address these challenges, we first identify a minimal set of “states” that are critical:
• A default state with balanced role assignments and full control.
• States with varied physical properties (via densities/inertia) affecting the ease of control and collision handling.
• States where the motor control mode (auto vs manual) is modified, thereby changing the control burden.
• States where a subset of obstacles or features is altered (e.g. by deactivation or role swapping) so that the goal structure is more or less “obvious.”

Accordingly, we propose the following minimal set of MMP functions:
1. mmp_reduce_density – slightly reduce all shape densities to decrease inertia and lower collision difficulty.
2. mmp_increase_density – slightly increase densities to make the physics and collisions more challenging.
3. mmp_enable_motor_auto – set motor_auto to True for all joints, reducing the control burden.
4. mmp_disable_motor_auto – force motor_auto to False for all joints, increasing manual control difficulty.
5. mmp_swap_shape_roles – randomly swap roles (e.g., between role 1 and role 2) for a subset of polygons and circles, subtly changing the reward landscape.
6. mmp_deactivate_random_obstacle – randomly deactivate one active dynamic shape, reducing clutter and collision complexity.

Each function is a minimal (atomic) perturbation that does not “cancel out” another deterministically. The functions use a single rng-split for randomness and perform immutable updates using the replace method on the EnvState.


************************* Assistant Response3 *************************

We first note that a general policy for an under‐specified POMDP in our Kinetix environment must handle the following skills:
1. Controlling the dynamics of bodies via motors and thrusters – that is, the policy must master both continuous and discrete aspects of joint and thruster control.
2. Exploiting the physical properties of bodies – including their density (mass‐related properties) and friction/contacts – to influence collision outcomes and reward signals.
3. Selecting relevant objects – that is, properly dealing with distractions or “clutter” (multiple shapes in the environment) so that the agent can focus on goal‐relevant features.

Given these skills, we identify a minimal set of states (or aspects of the state) that the policy must handle:
• The densities of polygons and circles (which affect how hard it is to push or move them).
• The motor auto flags (which decide whether joint motors are under agent control or are “free‐wheeling”).
• The “active” status of shapes (which determines if some shapes even participate in simulation collisions).

We then propose a minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions. We start with MMPs that reduce the challenge:
1. mmp_reduce_density – lowers the densities of polygon and circle shapes so that bodies are lighter and easier to manipulate.
2. mmp_set_motor_auto – sets all joint motors to “auto” so that the agent need not micromanage motor commands.

Then we introduce MMPs that increase the challenge:
3. mmp_increase_density – increases densities to make bodies heavier and collisions more punishing.
4. mmp_unset_motor_auto – disables motor auto control forcing the agent to directly control the joints.
5. mmp_remove_nonfloor_polygon – removes a non‐essential (non–floor) polygon from the environment, thereby reducing the number of “distractor” objects. (This may seem like “reducing” clutter but when removed inappropriately it can lead to a subtler, increased control challenge by forcing the agent to rely on fewer bodies.)

Each MMP function uses a single probabilistic operation (seeded with an rng key) and performs an immutable update exactly once.

1. Skills and Corresponding Relevant States:
   • Spatial reasoning & collision avoidance:
       – Relevant state: Positions of polygons and circles.
       – MMPs:
            ▸ mmp_increase_spacing: Slightly “spread out” all movable shapes to reduce collision probability.
            ▸ mmp_decrease_spacing: Move shapes closer together to increase the chance of collisions.
   • Motor/Thruster coordination:
       – Relevant state: The binary “motor_auto” flag that determines if joints are automatically controlled.
       – MMPs:
            ▸ mmp_enable_auto_motors: Set motor_auto flag to True to “assist” motor control.
            ▸ mmp_disable_auto_motors: Set motor_auto flag to False to force manual control.
   • Dynamics mass/inertia management (affecting movement and collisions):
       – Relevant state: The density parameters for polygons and circles.
       – MMPs:
            ▸ mmp_reduce_density: Lower shape densities to ease dynamics and reduce difficult behavior.
            ▸ mmp_increase_density: Increase shape densities to create heavier (and thus more challenging) dynamics.

2. Minimal Necessary Set of States:
   • Shape positions (for spatial arrangement and collision handling).
   • Motor auto-control flags (to affect motor coordination).
   • Density arrays for polygons and circles (affecting dynamics precision and collision resolution).

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) Functions:
   Each MMP function is implemented as a @jax.jit–decorated function that takes an rng key and an env_state (a UPOMDP state) and returns a modified env_state.
   – The functions below first use a small stochastic perturbation (seeded by the rng key) and then perform an atomic update on the appropriate state fields.
   – They are designed so that their operation does not conflict in a deterministic cancellation with one another.
   – The first two functions alter spatial arrangement (reduce or increase challenge by modifying spacing), the next two modify the motor_auto flag (assist vs. force manual control), and the final two adjust density parameters (easier dynamics versus more challenging dynamics).

We first analyze the skills that any agent (i.e. general policy) must master in order to solve any UPOMDP sampled from this environment. Key skills include:
• Spatial reasoning and the ability to navigate through environments with various object shapes, sizes, densities, and collision geometries.
• Mastering motor and thruster controls, including when joints are manually actuated versus automatically “helped” by the environment (via the motor_auto flag).
• Handling uncertainties from partially‐observable simulations, including managing noisy/dense reward signals and deep physical dynamics.
• Adapting to changes in dynamics due to variations in gravity, friction, density, and rigid‐body properties.

Based on these skills, we identify a minimum set of states that naturally appear in such environments:
1. States where the physical dynamics (i.e. gravity, friction, density) are “easier” — objects are softer, collisions result in less harsh penalties.
2. States where control is “easier” – for instance, joints are automatically actuated (motor_auto) so that the agent does not have to learn perfect motor actuation.
3. States where key simulation parameters are “harder” – such as increased gravity (faster falls), higher density or friction (more challenging collisions), and reduced auto‐controls – requiring the agent to learn more robust physics and control policies.

Accordingly, we produce a minimal set of Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions. We start with MMPs that reduce the challenge of the environment (e.g. reducing gravity, setting motor_auto to True, and lowering densities) and then proceed with MMPs that increase the challenge (e.g. increasing gravity, increasing friction, and increasing densities). Each MMP is implemented as a unique JAX‐jitted function that takes as input an rng key and an env_state (which is a POMDP instance), and returns a modified env_state.

Each MMP performs a single, non‐trivial atomic change (“perturbation”) that slightly alters one aspect of the simulation dynamics. The modifications are done in an immutable style using JAX operations. These minimal changes, while not canceling each other, cover the minimum set of states that are relevant to mastering the identified skills.

1. Skills Required:
   • Motor Control – The policy must learn to coordinate joint motors (via continuous/discrete actions) for complex body motion.
   • Thruster Control – The policy must coordinate thruster activations to navigate in the environment.
   • Spatial Reasoning and Object Interaction – The policy must interpret observation inputs (symbolic/pixels/entity) to identify objects, their roles (goal, hazard, etc.) and plan collision‐free trajectories.
   • Collision Management – The policy must avoid harmful interactions (collisions) while exploiting beneficial contacts to collect positive rewards.

2. Minimal Necessary Set of States:
   • States where motor control is eased (e.g. motor “auto” mode enabled) versus states where manual control is required.
   • States where the physical properties (mass/density) of shapes are lowered or increased to simplify or complicate the collision dynamics.
   • States where object roles (e.g. goal vs. hazard) are clearly set versus states where roles are shuffled, which can confuse the agent.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) Functions:
   To reduce difficulty:
   • mmp_reduce_difficulty_motor_auto: Set all motor_auto flags to True so that joint actions are “auto‐controlled.”
   • mmp_reduce_difficulty_density: Slightly decrease the densities of active polygons and circles to soften dynamics and collisions.

   To increase difficulty:
   • mmp_increase_difficulty_disable_auto: Disable motor_auto flags, forcing the policy to control every joint manually.
   • mmp_increase_difficulty_density: Increase the densities of active shapes so that inertia and collision effects become more pronounced.
   • mmp_increase_difficulty_role_shuffle: Randomly swap the roles assigned to polygon and circle shapes to perturb the reward structure.

Each MMP is implemented as an atomic JAX‐jit function that takes an rng key and an env_state and returns a modified env_state.

1. Skills to master for solving a UPOMDP in this environment:
   • Coordinated motor and thruster control – the policy must choose between joint actions and thruster actions.
   • Adaptation to varying object properties – including densities, inertias, and friction that influence physics.
   • Navigation and collision avoidance – the policy must deal with spatial arrangements, collisions, and rewards based on shape roles.
   • Sensitivity to “auto‐control” modes – some joints may be set to run automatically (motor_auto true), reducing control difficulty.

2. Minimum necessary states to cover these skills:
   • States where object densities (mass/inertia) are small – easing control and collision dynamics.
   • States where object densities are high – making the dynamics “heavier” and more challenging.
   • States where motor auto–control is enabled – reducing control responsibility.
   • States where motor auto–control is disabled – forcing the policy to control all joints.
   • States with “well–spaced” objects (e.g. via slight positional offsets) versus states with higher collision potential.
   • States with “normal” versus “increased” friction to test robustness in contact interactions.

3. Minimal Meaningful Perturbation (MMP) functions:
   • MMP functions that reduce challenge:
       – mmp_enable_motor_auto: force all joints into auto–mode.
       – mmp_reduce_shape_density: reduce the densities of polygons and circles.
       – mmp_offset_first_polygon: introduce a small offset to the first polygon to ease collision issues.
   • MMP functions that increase challenge:
       – mmp_disable_motor_auto: force all joints to require manual control.
       – mmp_increase_shape_density: increase the densities of polygons and circles.
       – mmp_increase_friction: increase friction values in rigid bodies, making sliding more difficult.

Each MMP is implemented as a JAX–jitted function with a single pass (no loop) and uses the provided RNG key to seed probabilistic changes. They perform minimal yet meaningful alterations to the environment state.
